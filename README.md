# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The motivation of our project was to create a website that gives fundamental details about HTML, CSS, Git and Javascript. It gives notes on HTML, CSS, Git and Javascript that one can refer to when they code. I learned a lot about how to sync my code on VS code to the Github application.
